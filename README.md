# ExpressWorks
Solutions to the ExpressWorks workshopper over at nodeschool.io

## Instructions
To use, clone with `git clone https://github.com/a2wd/ExpressWorks.git` and then grab dependencies with `npm install`

The solutions can be run on their own (though some require varying numbers of command-line arguments) or via the expressworks workshopper.

To get the workshopper, simple `npm install expressworks`

## Notes
Some people have noted problems running expressworks because of the wrong version of workshopper-exercise, on Linux this can usually be remedied by manually installing in the `/usr/bin/node_modules/expressworks` folder.

To do this, `cd` into the expressworks folder and `npm install workshopper-exercise`
